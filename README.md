# Mer-de-Glace

When talking about ultra-long-term storage, data **integrity quickly** becomes a challenge.
Software bugs, human errors, hardware failures are the most obvious causes of data loss... but sometimes data degrades "on their own", with no visible external cause. Phenomenon known as [data decay, data rot or bit rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation).

A common strategy is to multiply an odd number of backups, compare them and apply a rule where "*the majority gets the vote*". But it's leading to a costly and slow solution.

**Mer-de-Glace** stores an electronic signature when files are created then aims to report all kind of data corruption. 
Consequently, we can easily verify the integrity of each individual file on a smaller brunch of backups.

| :exclamation: | **Notez-bien :** **Mer-de-Glace** is still in it's very early stage. Documentation will be improved when a stable version will be released  |
|-------------|----------------------------|

See **UseCase** directory for compehensive example and use cases.

## Dependency
* **OpenSSL**

## Command line
**MdG** is the command line client to communication with **MerDeGlaced** daemon

`./MdG [-opt] command [arguments ...]`

with `./MdG -h` to get list of supported options. `./MdG help` to get the list of known command.

### Notes about commands
#### save
When the state is saved, using `save` command, all files/directories *creation* are de facto accepted.
*modification* and *deletion* still need explicit acceptation (using `accept` command) as they may highlight a storage issue.

#### RESET / RAZ
**RESET** command will reset the state of each file/directory and is only aimed to be used before a **scan**.
Typical usage : a lot of not committed modifications as been made, leading to a mess in the in-memory database.

As a rule of thumb, it's **always** better to avoid usage of **RESET** but commit frequently changes.

| :eyes: | After a **RESET**, in memory state is not anymore consistent until the next scan. In case of doubte, **restart *MerDeGlaced* without saving** and then launch a scan : it will reset data as per the real situation |
|-------------|----------------------------|

#### RECS
**Mer-de-Glace** keeps internal checksums to ensure in memory state as well as backup ones are not corrupted.
In **very rare** occasion, rebuilding them is needed : it's the goal of **RECS** (for *recalculate checksum*).

| :warning: | This command is **very dangerous** as checksum discrepancy is a proof of something going very bad (disk being corrupted, memory fault, hardware failure, ...). Consequently, this command is allowed ONLY if the daemon as been started in debug mode. |

## ToDo list
This is the list of identified tasks/behaviors. 
- *data management*
   - [X] Recursively scan a directory with MD5 checksum (v0.1)
   - [X] Save / load state	(v0.2)
   - [X] Restrict scanning to a sub directory (v0.3)
   - [X] re-scan and issue a report (v0.4)
   - [X] Accept a discrepancy (v0.6)
   - [ ] Guess dupplicate entries
   - [X] verify in memory and backup integrity (v0.7)

- *interfaces*
  - [X] accept commands via a socket (v0.4)
  - [ ] demonize (avoid as much as possible exiting in case of issue)
  - [X] Command line tool (v0.5)
  - [ ] long standing commands are aborted when client connection is lost
  - [ ] file system notification

- *for the future*
  - [ ] access to remote stats (is it really useful ?)
  - [ ] local configuration file (*Ã  la .access*)
  - [ ] versioning
